      <p style="font-size: 20px"> As a result of the
      technological boom that humanity is currently undergoing, the way that we
      connect to each other has been revolutionized. With the advent of social
      media, we have the ability to meet new people with the snap of a finger.
      The following information found in this piece discusses some of the
      features of a select few social media platforms. Additionally, I will
      be discussing my experience with these platforms as a teenager living in the
      21st Century. </p>

    <h3 class="smtitles" style="color: slateblue">Instagram</h3>
    <img src="../problem-set-3.5/Images/instagram-logo.png"
    title="Instagram Logo"/>
    <p style="color: #483d8b;">Instagram is a social media platform that allows users to
    post their images or videos on a customizable personal page. Each user
    has the ability to follow other users in order to keep up to date
    with their posts. Additionally, users can discover other users' pages
    through an explore feature, a personalized hub that suggests
    pages that may interest the user based on their activity.</p>

    <h3 class="smtitles" style="color: yellow">Snapchat</h3>
    <img id="sclogo" src="../problem-set-3.5/Images/snapchat-logo.png"
    title="Snapchat Logo"/>
    <p style="color: lemonchiffon;">Snapchat is a social media platform that
    allows users to take and edit
    short videos to post on a personalized story. Other users are then able to
    view and respond to this story. Additionally, the platform's chat feature
    allows two or more users to contact each other through messages, images,
    or videos. Each user has the ability to "add" other users in order to keep
    up to date with their stories.</p>

    <h3 class="smtitles">VSCO</h3>
    <img src="../problem-set-3.5/Images/vsco-logo.png"/
    title="VSCO Logo">
    <p>VSCO is a social media platform that has similar features to Instagram. It
    gives users the ability to share images or videos in a customizable personal
    page. However, VSCO allows users to upload and edit their images without
    having to post them. VSCO's photo-editing feature also gives users more
    customizing options to match their aesthetic. Each user has the ability to
    follow another user to keep up to date with their posts.</p>
