    <p><h1>My Experience with Social Media</h1></p>
    <p><h4>By: Celson Gutkowski</h4></p>
    <p> As a result of the technological boom that humanity is currently
      undergoing, the way that we connect to each other has been
      revolutionized. With the advent of social media, we have the ability to
      meet new people with the snap of a finger. </p>
    <p> The following information found in this piece will discuss some of the
      features of a select few social media platforms. Additionally, I will
      be discussing my experience with these platforms as a teenager living in the
      21st Century. </p>

    <p>Snapchat is a social media platform that allows users to take short
    videos and edit these videos to post on a personalized story. Additionally,
    Snapchat's chat feature allows two or more users to contact each other

    <p>VSCO is a social media platform that has similar features to Instagram. It
    gives users the ability to share images or videos in a customizable personal
    page. However, VSCO allows users to upload and edit their images without
    having to post them. Each user has the ability to follow each other users
    to keep up to date with their posts.</p>
