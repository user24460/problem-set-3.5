    title="Pages"/>
  	<h4 class="ftitles">Pages</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center">The personal page is one of Instagram's main features.
    On the personal page, the user's username, biography, and contact
    information is displayed. In addition, the personal page
    displays the number of people that the user follows or is followed
    by. All users are given the ability to post photos or videos with a
    caption, tag, and/or location. The photo or video will then be
    displayed onto the user's personal page, where followers can then
    like and add comments to the post. </p>
    <img src="../problem-set-3/Images/story feature 2.png" title="Stories"/>
    <h4 class="ftitles">Stories</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center">Similar to Snapchat, the
    user is given the ability to post photos or videos onto a
    personalized story that can then be viewed by other users. While
    there are options to customize these photos or videos before adding
    them to stories, Snapchat's customizing options are, in most cases,
    superior. Nonetheless, both platforms' story feature holds the same
    purpose: to quickly share photos or videos with other users.</p>
    <img src="../problem-set-3/Images/feed feature.jpg" title="Feed"/>
    <h4 class="ftitles">Feed</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center">In order to keep up to date with others, Instagram displays
      posts by other users on a constantly updating feed. The user can
      then scroll through this feed to like and comment on posts. Instead
      of displaying other users' posts in chronological order, Instagram
      uses an algorithm that orders them based on relevance to the
      user.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center; font-family: Impact;">My Experience</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center">Instagram has had a mixed effect on my life.
      It has brought positive
      change in that I am able to express myself through my page and see what
      my friends are up to by viewing their stories. Additionally, I have made
      new friends that I keep in contact with through Instagram. It has brought
      negative change in that I compare myself to others based on their photos,
      even though I realize that what they post are merely highlights of their
      real life. Furthermore, Instagram is extremely addictive and I sometimes
      spend hours exploring other users' pages when I could be doing something
      more productive. However, I still believe that Instagram is a wonderful
      platform to express yourself through, which is why I rate it a 4/5.</p>
