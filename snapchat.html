    title="Lenses"/>
  	<h4 class="ftitles">Lenses</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center">While taking photos or videos, users are given
      the ability to apply "lenses."
      These lenses use facial recognition software to make digital changes to the
      user's face. This produces unique effects such as making the user's eyes or mouth
      larger. In addition, it can also produce "masks," such as the iconic dog mask.
      The lense feature has made Snapchat extremely popular with its user base. </p>
    <img src="../problem-set-3/Images/chat feature.jpg"
    title="Chat"/>
    <h4 class="ftitles">Chat</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center">One of Snapchat's main features is the chat
      feature. Here, users are able to contact each other through short texts,
      photos, or videos. Additionally, users are able to send personal
      "bitmojis," which are emoticons that the user has customized. While the
      concept of direct messages is present in most other social media platforms,
      Snapchat's chat allows for quicker and more convenient messages.</p>
    <img src="../problem-set-3/Images/geolocation feature.jpg"
    title="Geo-Location"/>
    <h4 class="ftitles">Geo-Location</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center">Perhaps one of the most controversial features
      introduced by Snapchat is its "geo-location"
      feature. Geo-location allows users to hide or display their current location,
      as well as view
      the current location of other users. Using the smartphone's various sensors,
      such as an accelerometer,  Snapchat is
      able to accurately assume what users are doing, such as riding a car or sleeping.
      It then displays the user's bitmoji in geo-locations doing these activities.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align: center; font-family: Impact;">My Experience</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center">My experience with Snapchat has been tumultuous.
      In the past, I used it religiously. I remember spending
      hours chatting with friends or posting on my story. After a while, my enthusiasm
      for Snapchat mellowed down. Now, I rarely use it because I prefer to keep updated
      on my friends' lives through Instagram. I give Snapchat a rating of 2/5 because
      I now only use it for its lense feature, which is still quite enjoyable.</p>
