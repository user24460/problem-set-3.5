  	<h4>Personal Page</h4>
    <p>Much like Instagram, VSCO allows users to upload images and videos onto a personalized page. However, there are limits to VSCO's personal page feature in the sense that less information about the user is displayed. Despite this, the personal page still fulfills its function of allowing users to upload the photos they want to share with other users.</p>

    <h4>Studio</h4>
    <p>Among the three social media platforms discussed, VSCO offers the most options to editing a photo or video. In studios, users are able to import media from their camera roll. From there, users are given a variety of choices to customize their photo or video, including adding various filters that give each photo or video a unique aesthetic.</p>
     <p>Below is a list of some of VSCO's photo-editing options.<p>
    <ul>
      <li>Exposure</li>
      <li>Contrast</li>
      <li>Saturation</li>
      <li>White Balance</li>
      <li>Grain</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>My Experience</h3>
    <p> Although I have only been using VSCO for a relatively short amount of time compared to Instagram or Snapchat, I am very pleased with its functionality. VSCO is my go to platform when I want to edit my photos. I also enjoy having another medium, other than Instagram, where I am able to post photos that would otherwise stay in my camera roll. However, there could be improvements made to VSCO, such as including the ability to discover other users directly from another user's personal page. Because of this, I give VSCO a rating of 3/5. </p>
