  	<h4 class="ftitles">Personal Page</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center">Much like Instagram, VSCO allows users to
      upload images and videos onto a personalized page. However, there are
      limits to VSCO's personal page feature in the sense that less information
      about the user is displayed. Despite this, the personal page still
      fulfills its function of allowing users to upload the photos they want
      to share with other users.</p>
    <img src="../problem-set-3.5/Images/studio feature.png"
    title="Studio"/>
    <h4 class="ftitles">Studio</h4>
    <p style="text-align: center">Among the three social media platforms
      discussed, VSCO offers the most options to editing a photo or video.
      In studios, users are able to import media from their camera roll.
      From there, users are given a variety of choices to customize their
      photo or video, including adding various filters that give each photo
      or video a unique aesthetic.</p>
    <p align="center">Below is a list of some of VSCO's photo-editing options.<p>
    <ul>
      <li>Exposure</li>
      <li>Contrast</li>
      <li>Saturation</li>
      <li>White Balance</li>
      <li>Grain</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="text-align: center; font-family: Impact;">My Experience</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center"> Although I have only been using VSCO for a
      relatively short amount of time compared to Instagram or Snapchat, I am
      very pleased with its functionality. VSCO is my go to platform when I
      want to edit my photos. I also enjoy having another medium, other than
      Instagram, where I am able to post photos that would otherwise stay in
      my camera roll. However, there could be improvements made to VSCO,
      such as including the ability to discover other users directly from
      another user's personal page. Because of this, I give VSCO a rating of
      3/5. </p>
